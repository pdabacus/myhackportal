Course Database Design
 - the first table will hold all the details for a given course
 - it will also have a list of semesters the course was offered
 - using the course id and semester, generate int for range of section_id's
 - the second table will have all the sections for every course and semester
 - each section has the location, days, and professor

Example:
table courses: key=course_id, value=course_num,course_name,reqs,desc,semesters
